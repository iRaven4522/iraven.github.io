            <h1>iBook G4 running Mac OS 9 (Unofficially)</h1>
            <hr>
            <!--text-->
                So, decided to start off this public random blog with this, neat.
                Crossing my fingers if this formats correctly too. If it doesn't, fuck shit in a dick. (Spoiler alert, it didn't. :())
                <br><br>
                I was contacted by a viewer of a video on my channel (about running Mac OS 9 on my iBook), as they wanted to do the same.
                <br><br>
                Heeeere comes the context though- the video on my channel was published in 2019- <em>The video was recorded in November 2017. Halp.</em>
                <br><br>
                Obviously having no clue on how to do this off the top of my head, and there being no official guide (as results on different systems are mixed), I had to go through older bookmarks I saved in 2017.
                <br><br>
                This whole ordeal is trial-error, there isn't any official guides for a reason. My research involved a lot of commands/tinkering on forum posts on respective forums MacOS9Lives!, ThinkClassic, and 68kmla.
                <br><br>
                With no modifications, inserting an OS9 install CD (Unsupported G4s version is preferred- find it on MacOS9Lives.) into the machine results in it appearing in Startup Manager, however upon booting to no avail - a grey screen. This is the normal behavior as iBooks in this era shipped with some OSX version (and was far into OSX at the time).
                <br><br>
                This is due to it detecting the computer information - model identifier, processor type, version, etc. and Mac OS 9 was last developed in 2002- when iBook G4s were produced in 2004. It's incompatible on a hardware level- because of how OS9 is, not the actual hardware itself.
                <br><br>
                (The G4 chip is leaps and bounds capable of running OS9.)
                <br><br>
                Open Firmware is your friend in this case and is extensively used. The only required thing to get OS9 to detect a valid system to boot on is to 'derp it' and make it identify falsely equipped with an older PPC G4/chip.
                <br><br>
                Open Open Firmware (lol) with the key combo Alt, Command, O, and F on startup immediately after the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyvOz0HK9ss">bong.</a>
                <br><br>
                It should go to a command/terminal interface. My iBook is identified as PowerBook6,5- yours may be different and the following may not apply to you. If you happen to have the same model, <em>eyy 6,5 gang. XD</em>
                <br><br>
                We're now going to enter nvedit mode- a mode for entering a script of OF commands to be eventually saved in your computer's NVRAM. (If your computer has a dead CMOS battery- replace it, else you're going to have to do the following every. single. time. For the iBooks this doesn't apply.)
                <br><br>
                Simply type nvedit to enter this mode. Your cursor should jump below the field you just typed on.
                Type these commands exactly how they appear on screen:
                <br><br>
                " /cpus/@0" find-package if drop " /cpus/@0" find-device 80010201 encode-int " cpu-version" property then
                <br><br>
                " /cpus/@1" find-package if drop " /cpus/@1" find-device 80010201 encode-int " cpu-version" property then
                <br><br>
                You won't be able to see anything you're typing, have a decent keyboard with you. Or just be careful.
                <br><br>
                After these commands are entered, press Ctrl + C to exit nvedit mode, then type nvstore to save the above commands in NVRAM.
                <br><br>
                After that, you need to enable a setting so the script runs on each startup. Type: setenv use-nvramrc? 1
                to enable it.
                <br><br>
                After that, you should be good to go- make sure your computer has a stable power source and then type reset-all to immediately reboot.
                <br><br>
                Do whatever method you did before to start up to the OS9 CD. Make sure it's the special patched "Unsupported G4s" version from MacOS9Lives- Normal installation discs won't work without other OF commands.
                <br><br>
                If happy mac goto success. You should be able to install OS9- with a catch.
                <br><br>
                <em>Suggestion: The image file it installs on there using ASR (Apple Software Repair/Update) may not work when you boot from the HD- in my experience, copying the contents of the CD to the HD is preferred, and then manually sifting through extensions and control panels (in case any rogue ones get in the way).</em>
