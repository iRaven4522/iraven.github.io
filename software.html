        <h2>TranstarArchive</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/iraven4522/transtararchive" target="_blank">get it on github here!</a>
            <p>this program was fueled by weird nostalgia i have for the houston area, as i used to live around the waller/cypress area as a kid, we went there for lots of things
            <br>houston (really SE TX) has their own set of traffic cameras, hosted and managed by <a href="https://www.houstontranstar.org" target="_blank">Houston Transtar</a>
            <br>they have a website that you can use to access all of these cameras, though they indicate none of these are archived, nor can you get live video feeds from them consumer-wise
            <br>this program aims to bring that to anyone who is curious about the area, has similar nostalgia that i do, or wants to archive footage of cameras from this area</p>
        <h2>SubFileMover</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/iraven4522/subfilemover" target="_blank">get it on github here!</a>
            <p>very very simple program i did for a teacher at my school to extract files from subfolders and rename them putting folder names in front of filenames,
            <br>then moving them to a parent folder. nothing too special, intended for the Schoology platform</p>
